            <p>
                <b>
                    There is a lot of information here about hammock camping and what to look for in a hammock system because this is new to many of you. There is some information about how to select a good hammock and accessories but please keep in mind that if you would like to borrow a hammock there is probably one available. 
                </b>
            </p>
            <br>
            <b>The Hammock:</b>
            <p>
                There are a LOT of different style hammocks in the world, however, generally if you are talking about hammock camping, you would use a gathered end hammock. There are other designs that are used for camping, but they tend to be more expensive and specialized. Even among gathered end hammocks there can be a lot of variability. Including length, width, single piece of fabric, material with or without ridgeline, integrated bug net, etc.  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Suspension (Are Straps Included):
                    </b>
                    Some hammocks come with straps but many especially the higher end hammocks do NOT include straps in which case the straps must be purchased separately. You CANNOT just use a rope. (See more on suspension systems below)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Length: 
                    </b>
                    In general a longer hammock will be more comfortable, especially for taller campers (or campers who will grow tall). I would typically recommend a 10-12 foot hammock. Keep in mind many inexpensive hammock manufactures include the carabiners or other suspension components when they are measuring hammock length.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Width:
                    </b>
                    in most cases for camping you would want a double hammock. A double hammock does NOT mean it’s for 2 people. A double hammock is approximately twice as wide as a single. Most of the time you will sleep on a diagonal of the hammock. See image below. A single hammock is fine for day use, but they tend to be confining for overnight camping and often doesn’t allow you to sleep on the diagonal
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>
                                Seams: 
                            </b>
                            This is admittedly a minor consideration, but some hammocks add width by adding an additional piece of fabric on each edge. Most hangs that’s not a big deal, but I’ve hung my hammock where when, I find a comfortable laying position, the seams are in the middle of my face. All things being equal, I would prefer a hammock without seams, but it’s not a deal breaker
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Ridgeline:
                    </b>
                    There are several advantages of having a ridgeline. A ridgeline can help you get the right sag in your hammock and make it much easier to set up. It is also useful to hang accessories on (More on that later). That being said, I have never had a hammock with a ridgeline attached, although I would like to. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Material:
                    </b>
                    There are a LOT of different types of materials. This can be an interesting rabithole to go down. I know there are people who are very sensitive to material texture and feel, but I’m not one of them. A good resource for understanding at least some of the materials used to make Hammocks is Ripstop by the Roll. They are distributor of materials for the cottage manufactures and DIYers. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Integrated Bug Net:
                    </b>
                    A bug net is nice to have but certainly not required. Integrating a bug net significantly reduces weight for backpacking. I personally have and prefer a separate bug net (more on this in accessories). 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>Suspension (Are Straps Included???)</b>
            <p>
                If you spend much time investigating camping and backpacking hammocks you will quickly discover that one of the most confusing parts of hammock camping is the huge diversity of suspension systems or the components used to hang your hammock. Some times they are included when you buy a hammock and sometimes they are not. Most of the more complex systems are to minimize weight for backpacking. If you have never hammock camped I would recommend using simple hammock straps or slings. (See images below). Additionally I would recommend the longest straps you can find to provide flexibility in where you can hang your hammock. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                YOU MAY NOT USE JUST ROPE!
            </h2>
            <p>
                There are 2 reasons. 1st straps must be at least 1 inch wide. Narrow straps or ropes can damage the trees. 2nd, most ropes are not strong and durable enough to support the continued weight and forces of a hammock..                           
            </p>
            
            <h2>
                Tarp
            </h2>
            <p>
                You will also need a tarp to keep you and your sleeping gear dry however there are lots of options for tarps. 
                Remember that when you hang a hammock it is supposed to have some sag, so the distance between the ends of your hammock will be shorter than the reported hammock length. 
                The hanging distance of a 10’ hammock should be ~ 8.5’ and the hang distance for a 12’ hammock is ~ 10’. See <a href="https://theultimatehang.com/hammock-hang-calculator/">this calculator</a> to determine the approximate hang length of your hammock. 
                A tarp should extend  6” to 12” beyond each end of your hammock, so the total tarp length should be 1-2’ longer than the hang length of your hammock. 
                But you should keep in mind that it’s often easier to hang a tarp along the diagonal like the image on the left. 
                Additionally a tarp that is too big will be challenging to hang over your hammock. In this case smaller is better.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Stakes:
                    </b>
                    No matter what shape or orientation you hang your tarp you will need stakes and guylines. Please make sure that you have sufficient quantity for your tarp and that they are tied onto your tarp in a way that will minimize tearing the tarp in case of wind. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Rope-
                    </b>
                    You may also need a ridgeline to hang your tarp on. Paracord or similar ropes generally work well for hanging a tarp. (Note this is NOT the same ridgeline that might be a part of your hammock)

                        Hammock Tarp -
                    </b>
                    Hammock tarps come in a variety of shapes and sizes. In the section below, I list some brands I have experience with.

                    Hardware store Tarp -
                    </b>
                    You can get just a standard tarp from any hardware Store. I have even seen them at the dollar store. They are frequently blue, but often come in other colors too. I wouldn’t recommend this as a long term solution, but they will work for the duration of camp. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Used Billboards -
                    </b>
                    Billboard advertisements are made out of a very durable waterproof vinyl and they can be used as a tarp. Someone mentioned that they have gotten old billboards from Lamar (free? Or very low cost). However, typically you get what you get so you might get a billboard with ads for a restaurant, truckstop, hotel chain, etc. Additionally you will have to figure how to add grommets or some other way to attach your tarp to a rope.

            </ul>
            
            <h2>Accessories.</h2>
            <p>
                There are far more accessories available than I am going to discuss here. NONE of these are required to camp in a hammock
            </p>

                        Bug net:  
                    </b>
                    A standalone bug net is like a tube of netting that you put your hammock inside of and it clinches around the ends of your hammock. I prefer a separate bug net because I don’t always need it, it’s more work to install, and while I have found my bug net to be remarkably durable, it’s still the most fragile component in my hammock system.
                </li>

                    <b>
                        Ridgeline: 
                    </b>
                    Functionally a Ridgeline can mean different things. A ridgeline can be added to the hammock itself to make it easier to hang for a specific hang length, but you can also have separate ridgelines for a bug net and/or tarp. You can also use a ridgeline to hang a shelf or lights. I have hung my glasses from a ridgeline. 
                </li>

                        Insulation: 
                    </b>
                    I’m including insulation as an accessory because in August it’s likely not a necessity, however, if you are camping at other times of the year insulation will be crucial for a warm night's sleep. When you sleep in a sleeping bag, your body weight compresses all of the fibers underneath you and the sleeping bag will only provide minimal warmth even (especially?) a high end ultralight fluffy sleeping bag. This means that on your top you will be nice and toasty warm and on your bottom, you will be freezing. In a tent you would be sleeping on a pad that provides the insulation, but in a hammock you are exposed to the air.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>
                                Sleeping bag and pad: 
                            </b>
                        A typical tent sleeping pad can be put inside of a hammock to provide insulation. It does pretty well, but there may be cold spots where your shoulders and hips are against the side of the hammock. Note this is the solution I currently use when the weather is cooler but I sleep warm so in August, I probably won’t bother.
                        </li>

                            </b>
                        They do make extra wide sleeping pads to use with a hammock. I have never used one and I believe that those who do give them mixed reviews.

                            The ideal solution is an underquilt or a special quilt that hangs underneath your hammock to provide insulation. They would look like a sleeping bag that you cut in half longways. An underquilt can be paired with a sleeping bag or a top-quilt. A top-quilt is basically just a blanket that looks like a sleeping bag.

                DIY Hammock and Accessories: 
            </b>
            <p>
                A hammock is theoretically very easy to sew. The challenge would is working with the slippery materials. Typical hammock materials are usually not available at your local fabric store, but you can buy it from <a href="https://ripstopbytheroll.com/">Ripstop by the Roll.</a> They have material guides to help you, but they also have kits for hammocks, tarps, and bug nets.

            <h2>
                Hammock Vendors
            </h2>
            <p>
                I bought the hammock I use several years ago at Costco for $7. A few years later I decided to upgrade and bought a hammock with good reviews from on sale at Amazon for about $30. The hammock from Amazon turned out to be AWFUL. It was incredibly uncomfortable. I tried to give it to one of my kids but they couldn’t sleep in it either. I don’t remember what was wrong with it, but I know it ended up in the garbage and I’m still using my $7 Costco special. There are hundreds of inexpensive options on Amazon or other places where you can get a hammock, tarp, bug net, and straps without spending a lot of money. However, the problem with getting some inexpensive gear is that often the design and quality control are hit or miss. It is possible to get good equipment, but you have to be very careful and/or lucky.
                I would recommend using fakespot or similar sites when evaluating reviews especially from large retailers.

            <h1>
                Why are hammocks required for camp this year and the problems with “Family Camping”
            </h1>
            <p>
                Originally, the current church and NYS guidelines recommended ‘family camping’ to minimize spread of COVID-19 among camp participants. This means that campers could ONLY sleep in a tent with members of their immediate household. Generally, this would be limited to siblings and parents or guardians. This had the potential to significantly reduce attendance and increase logisitics.
            </p>
            <h2>
                An Inspired Solution - Hammock Camping
            </h2>
            <p>
                The reason ‘family camping’ has been mandated is to prevent people from being confined in the same airspace together for long periods of time. The answer is the hammock. It allows us to meet both the spirit and letter of the ‘family camping’ law. I also think it is more comfortable than sleeping on a cot or the ground. All young men and anyone camping in a campsite with young men, hammock camp will be required to hammock camp. Adults that will be at camp but will not be in a campsite with young men may choose to sleep in a tent, but it will be discouraged.  
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Campers sleeping in a hammock aren’t confined in an enclosed space and thus aren’t breathing the same air as their neighbors especially if each hammock is covered with a rain fly.
                </li>
                <li>
                Hammocks will be set up in clusters or villages consisting of a squad of 4-6 young men like those shown in the photographs below so that campers are near one another and easily within sight and sound of adjacent campers.
                </li>
                <li>
                There are admittedly some concerns with hammock camping, but I think those concerns are easily overcome. Concerns may include the following:
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                Availability and cost
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Many of the YM in the stake already have hammocks and have used them in previous scouting activities. (I know most of the YM in my ward already have a Hammock).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Almost every member of the stake that I have spoken with about using hammocks has said their family has extra hammocks we could borrow if necessary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inexpensive hammocks are available for as low as ~$25 including straps and a tarp. At that price range they probably aren’t the most comfortable or of the highest quality, but they should easily last for the duration of camp.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can get a high-quality hammock with straps for approximately $65. Starting in this price range hammocks will last for years of use and hundreds of nights of camping. Links of some possible options are listed below. 
                </li>                
                <li>
                    A hammock is very simple to sew. If there is interest, we could have hammock sewing activities and make our own high-quality hammock for approximately $25 in materials and 2 hours of sewing. Link to DIY kits below. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    In general, a hammock is much less expensive than a tent setup of comparable quality.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                Rain and cold weather
            </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    A rain tarp can be as simple as a dollar store tarp and 20’ of paracord. Yes, you can buy a tarp at the dollar store; this would not be my first choice, but it is a perfectly adequate solution. There are more durable and nicer solutions available at a higher cost. Links to options below. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sleeping pad. If the nighttime temperatures are going to be below ~ 60-70degrees campers may want to bring a sleeping pad to sleep on so they don’t get cold. I suspect this will not be necessary in the first week of August. They can use the same pad they would use in a tent.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There is a YM in my ward who is on staff at Massawepie Scout camp. He slept in his hammock every night last summer WITHOUT a rain fly or sleeping pad. He said he sometimes got damp, but when he sunk into the hammock there was only a narrow opening for rain at the top and generally the rain didn’t get through. While I wouldn’t recommend not using a tarp if there is a chance of rain, it’s also probably not an emergency if it happens.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Bugs and critters

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Some hammocks have a bug net sewn into them, but there are also bug nets that fit over top of a stand-alone hammock. Options below. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    If we were using the canvas tents at the scout camp, they do NOT have bug nets.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>
                Privacy and Storage
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Although we won’t be using them, the canvas tents at the scout camp will still be set up. Most of the time the tent flaps will be tied open so that you can see through the tents, however, when someone needs to change clothes or needs privacy, they can use a tent to change for short periods of time. Only one camper will be in a tent at one time.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The tents could also provide storage for campers’ personal belongings if they choose.
