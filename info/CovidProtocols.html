                COVID-19 Protocols
            </h2>
            <p>
                Current COVID protocols require that facemasks be worn indoors, no matter vaccination status.  Companies must also maintain six feet of separation from members of other companies.
            </p><p>
                In addition, most of the covid-19 protocols below are based on the logistics of camp and are not activity specific. Specific plans for each activity at camp will be developed once those activities have been identified.
            </p>                
            <h2>
                Outdoors
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the easiest and most effective methods of minimizing COVID-19 transmission is to be outdoors especially in warm weather, with transmission rates as much as 20x lower when outside. Camp will occur almost completely outdoors. There will be activity plans that will utilize the open-air pavilions, but we will minimize our use of lodges and enclosed spaces. We will also generate secondary activity plans in case of inclement weather that will further utilize and share the open-air, but covered spaces.
            </p>

                The problems with “Family Camping”
            </h2>
            <p>
                Originally, the current church and NYS guidelines recommended ‘family camping’ to minimize spread of COVID-19 among camp participants. This means that campers could ONLY sleep in a tent with members of their immediate household. Generally, this would be limited to siblings and parents or guardians. This had the potential to significantly reduce attendance and increase logisitics.
            </p>
            <h2>
                An Inspired Solution - Hammock Camping
            </h2>
            <p>
The reason ‘family camping’ has been mandated is to prevent people from being confined in the same airspace together for long periods of time. The answer is the hammock. It allows us to meet both the spirit and letter of the ‘family camping’ law. I also think it is more comfortable than sleeping on a cot or the ground. All young men and anyone camping in a campsite with young men, hammock camp will be required to hammock camp. Adults that will be at camp but will not be in a campsite with young men may choose to sleep in a tent, but it will be discouraged.  </p>
            <p>
            There is a LOT more information about hammock camping on the <a href="HammockInfo.html">Hammock camping page</a>. I would strongly suggest you explore the information at that site. .  
                </p>
                <p>
Campers sleeping in a hammock aren’t confined in an enclosed space and thus aren’t breathing the same air as their neighbors especially if each hammock is covered with a rain fly.
                </p>
                <p>
Hammocks will be set up in clusters or villages consisting of a squad of 4-6 young men like those shown in the photographs below so that campers are near one another and easily within sight and sound of adjacent campers.
            </p>
            <p>
            Although COVID restrictions continue to loosen, hammock camping is still recommended for all youth and leaders.
            </p>

                Companies – Platoon - Squad
            </h2>
            <p>
                The camp is divided into companies, platoons, and squads. In a typically non-pandemic year, most activities at camp would be by company and platoons, but there would still be many other activities that would be camp-wide. However, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 if there were to be a positive case at camp, YM will spend the week in their squads and platoons, similar to the way ‘pods’ are being utilized in many of the local school districts to keep students socially distant from one another.
                Unfortunately, there may be fewer camp-wide activities this year. Although we will still have devotionals, campfires, and other meetings. Depending on the conditions at the time of camp some of those meetings may occur at the company level. (3 separate firesides going on at the same time. 1 for each of the priesthood companies).
            </p>
            <h2>
                Campsites
            </h2>
            <p>
                In addition to separating the YM into companies by priesthood age, the company campsites will be physically distant from one another. If a company had sufficient YM, or if their campsite is small, they may occupy more than one campsite, however, the Deacons company campsites would still be physically separated from the Teachers Company Campsite. See the map at the end of this document for a preliminary idea of where campers will be.
            </p>
            <h2>
                PPE and Morning Checks
            </h2>
            <p>
                This year for camp we are printing both t-shirts and face masks. Masks will be required to be worn over the mouth AND nose at all times the camper is indoors with a few exceptions for eating, etc. Every exception will be reviewed by the health officer to ensure the safety of all campers.
            </p><p>
                Every morning I have to fill out a survey for my kids’ school that asks if the kids are feeling ill; do they have a fever, or other COVID-19 symptoms; have they been around someone else who has tested positive; have they traveled out of state; etc. When parents drop their sons off for camp, they will complete a similar survey. Each morning one of the company adults will also take every YM’s temperature and ask similar questions for every person in camp. A report from each company will be reported to the health officer each morning.
            </p><p>
                The health officer will determine their own level of PPE requirements which may be higher than the general camp population so that they can evaluate any potential issues.
            </p>

                Bathroom and Shower Arrangements

            <p>
                The following accommodations are being put in place to sanitize bathrooms and showers to make them safe for campers by Babcock Hovey.
            </p><p>
                Babcock Hovey staff will spray down bathrooms and showers with commercial cleaner every morning and evening. The disinfectant sprays will be left at the bathroom facilities and campers will be instructed to use disinfectant between each user.
